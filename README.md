Trafo Pop
=========

wearable LEDs using Arduino Nano or Arduino Pro Micro and WS2801

This repositiory contains the software for the "build your own LED jacket" workshops.

http://www.trafopop.com/arduino-led-jacket-workshop

We have several branches, one for each jacket, coat, hat or bag:

- master
- cp
- mg
- pr
- sh
- ap
- mb
- db
- sk
…

Each branch is different because of different layout. It can also be different because of
different colors or scaling.
Please switch to your branch.
