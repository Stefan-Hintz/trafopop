wearable LEDs using Arduino Nano and WS2801

This repositiory contains the software for the "build your own LED jacket" workshop.

http://www.trafopop.com/arduino-led-jacket-workshop

We have several branches, one for each jacket, coat, hat or bag:

- master
- cp
- mg
- pr
- sh
- ap
- mb
- db
- sk
…

Each branch is different because of different layout. It can also be different because of
different colors or scaling.
Please switch to your branch.

The code in this branch is used for the Three Triangel: http://www.trafopop.com/project/led-jacket-david-triangel/
